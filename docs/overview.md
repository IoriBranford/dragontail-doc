# Overview

Rose of Dragontail is a fantasy belt-scrolling brawler game.

## Concept

The dragon-child Rose wields draconic powers in battle against mobs of criminals and monsters. She must journey across the dragon isles and drink from all the hidden blood fountains to complete her transformation before she dies of thirst.

## Target Audience

The target audience is fantasy and fighting fans 13 years or older.

## Flow

A stage is a linear sequence of combat arenas connected by corridors. Before each stage is a short story sequence. Once play begins, Rose moves through the stage while enemies appear and attack her. When she enters an arena she must defeat all enemies to advance to the next arena. When she defeats the boss enemy in the last arena, she wins the stage. The game plays a concluding story sequence before advancing to the next stage or the end of the story.
