# Overview

## Concept

Rose of Dragontail is a fantasy belt-scrolling brawler game for ages 13 and up.

Rose, a girl undergoing dragon transformation, battles criminals and monsters with her draconic powers. She must journey across the Dragon Isles and drink from all the hidden blood fountains to unlock new powers and complete her transformation, or else she will die of thirst.

## Flow

A stage is a linear sequence or a tree of connected combat arenas. Before each stage is a short story sequence. Once play begins, Rose moves through the stage while enemies appear and attack her. When she enters an arena she must defeat all enemies to advance to the next arena. When she defeats the boss enemy in the last arena, she wins the stage. The game plays a concluding story sequence before advancing to the next stage or the end of the story.

## Look and Feel

Rose of Dragontail is set in a colorful pixel fantasy world with minor anime and manga influence. The gameplay and interface feel smooth, fast, and impactful.
