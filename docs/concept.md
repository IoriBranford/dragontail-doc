# Concept Document

One or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.

**Genre:** Beat-em-up action

**Target audience**: Fantasy and fighting fans age 13 and up. (ESRB T)

## Unique Selling Points

This game is the only beat-em-up where you fight with the superhuman powers of a dragon. Your tail whips and throws send enemies flying farther than any human hand can match.

## Player Experience and Game POV

Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the player? What emotions do you want the player to feel? What keeps the player engaged for the duration of their play?

## Visual and Audio Style

What is the “look and feel” of the game? How does this support the desired player’s experience? What concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game?

## Game World Fiction

Briefly describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms (as presented to the player).

## Monetization

How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this within the design?

## Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief)

PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript? How long to make, and how big a team? How long to first-playable? How long to complete the game? Major risks?

## Core Loops

How do game objects and the player’s actions form loops? Why is this engaging? How does this support player goals? What emergent results do you expect/hope to see? If F2P, where are the monetization points?

## Objectives and Progression

How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from tutorial to end? What are their short-term and long-term goals (explicit or implicit)? How do these support the game concept, style, and player-fantasy?

## Game Systems

What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the player interact with?

## Interactivity

How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog, Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does the player move through the world? How does physics/combat/etc. work? A clear, professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.
