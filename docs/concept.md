# Concept Document

*One or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.*

**Genre:** Beat-em-up

**Target audience**: Fantasy and fighting fans age 13 and up (ESRB T)

## Unique Selling Points

This game brings arcade beat-em-up action to the fantasy realm, where you can fight using the superhuman powers of a dragon. Your tail whips and throws send enemies flying farther than any human hands.

## Player Experience and Game POV

*Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the player? What emotions do you want the player to feel? What keeps the player engaged for the duration of their play?*

You play Rose, a coastal village girl in a 16th-17th-century fantasy land. After her first taste of dragon blood, she has begun to transform into a dragon.

As Rose, you experience the thrill of heroic battles using dragon powers against mobs of villains. 

## Visual and Audio Style

*What is the “look and feel” of the game? How does this support the desired player’s experience? What concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game?*

The aesthetic is colorful pixel fantasy with minor anime and manga influence. The gameplay and interface feel smooth, fast, and impactful.

## Game World Fiction

*Briefly describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms (as presented to the player).*

## Monetization

*How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this within the design?*

## Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief)

*PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript? How long to make, and how big a team? How long to first-playable? How long to complete the game? Major risks?*

The game will target PCs first. The graphics will be 2D in order to get a head start with store-bought and Creative Commons assets. The tools are LOVE app framework, Tiled map editor, LibreOffice Calc for data editing, and Github/Gitlab for code repository and build automation.

The team is a single developer as programmer, designer, and producer. Art, music and sound assets will be free, bought, or hired.

## Core Loops

*How do game objects and the player’s actions form loops? Why is this engaging? How does this support player goals? What emergent results do you expect/hope to see? If F2P, where are the monetization points?*

## Objectives and Progression

*How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from tutorial to end? What are their short-term and long-term goals (explicit or implicit)? How do these support the game concept, style, and player-fantasy?*

## Game Systems

*What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the player interact with?*

Player-facing systems

- Fighting physics - striking, grabbing, throwing, slamming into walls or hazards
- Fighter condition - health, ability to attack and move

Internal systems

- Enemy dispatch - add enemies when player advances to certain points in the level
- Enemy behavior - decide move and attack based on situation and skill level

## Interactivity

*How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog, Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does the player move through the world? How does physics/combat/etc. work? A clear, professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.*
